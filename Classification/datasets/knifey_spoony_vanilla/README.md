# The Knifey-Spoony Data-Set

[Original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/knifey-spoony)

## Introduction

* This is the Knifey-Spoony image data-set.
* The images show 3 types of objects: Cutlery knives, spoons and forks on a few different backgrounds.
* The classes are named: knifey, spoony and forky. (It's a spoof from The Simpsons on the 1980's movie Crocodile Dundee.)
* These images are used in [TensorFlow Tutorial #09](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/08_Video_Data.ipynb) as an example of a classification problem.
* There is a [script](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/convert.py) for converting videos to images so you can easily create your own data-set with thousands of images from just a few video-recordings.

## Images

* All images are 200 x 200 pixels with 3 colour channels.
* There is a total of 4700 jpg-images of which 530 are test-images with different backgrounds than the training-set.
* The knifey class has 1347 images total (137 images in the test-set).
* The spoony class has 2208 images total (242 images in the test-set).
* The forky class has 1145 images total (151 images in the test-set).
